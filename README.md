# Diffusion Models
This is a repo for playing around with diffusion models.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: this is a hobby project, 
I cannot guarantee that all implementations are correct or faithful to the respective papers!

## Current results
Following the most recent commits, the models appear to behave in a stable fashion. 
Since this is a recent development as of the time of writing, I only have some results to show:

Images generated using the `eval_model.py` using DDPM (cosine schedule) with T=1000, seed=42 on a (still training) 
103 million parameter model (h_size=64, resolution 128x128 on FFHQ Thumbnails):

And some results of a cute little 32x32 model trained on CelebA for 42 epochs:

### Does DDIM work?
Not yet completely üòÖ:

This paper was the biggest source of information I used. Most notably the cosine scheduler.

### Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (2020)
[Arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)

The paper upon which the previously mentioned paper builds. 
Contains some clear math and pseudocode which made my life a lot easier.

    showing the transition from a standard normal distribution to something very similar to the training set:
